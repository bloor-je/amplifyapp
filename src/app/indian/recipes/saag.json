    "First, chop the {onion} and fry in half the {oil} for 5 minutes in a pan (big enough to hold the finished dish) on a medium heat until softened/carmelised, stirring every 30s. Be careful not to let the onion burn as this will taint the entire dish.",
    "Next create a base mixture by blending the fried {onion} with half the {yog}, {garlic}, {ginger},a splash of cold water and quater of the {tomatos} until smooth.",
    "Chop the {meat} into small cube shaped pieces (smaller pieces absorb more flavour) and add them to the pan which the onions were fried in with the remaining {oil}. Cook on a medium heat stirring regularly until the {meat} is sealed (5-10 minutes).",
    "Now add the base mixture, the {salt}, and the {asfo} into the pan with the meat, cook on a low heat for 10 minutes.",
    "Next add the {tomatos} to the pan and increase the heat to medium for 10 minutes, stir regularly.",
    "Add the {coriander}, {cumin}, {turmeric}, {chilliePowder}, {cinamon}, {pepper} and {fenugreek} to the pan with a splash of cold water to prevent the spices from burning. Mix well and leave to simmer on a low heat for 10 minutes.",
    "Whilst the mixture simmers, wash and chop the {spinach} and {chillies}, try to drain as much of the water out of the spinach as possible to speed up the cooking.",
    "Once the 10 minutes has passed, add the {spinach} into the pan, increase the temperature to high and stir well for 5 minutes or until all the spinach has wilted, then reduce the temperature to low and cook for at least 10 minutes or until the excess liquid has boiled off.",
    "Once the excess liquid has reduced, add the remaining {yog} and the {chillies} to the dish and cook on a medium heat for 5 minutes.",
    "Heat the {naan} as described on the packet.",
    "Finally, add the {freshCoriander} to the curry and stir well for 30s. Serve the curry then garnish it with {garam}, serve the {naan} on a seperate plate.",
    "Enjoy!"
